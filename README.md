## üìñ Abstract

This project aims to develop a stopwatch application with the following core functionalities:

- Start
- Stop
- Reset
- Lap recording

The application updates in real-time using Java‚Äôs multithreading capabilities and displays time in the format: **HH:MM:SS.ms**. Built with AWT components and an Applet interface, it showcases object-oriented design principles, event-driven programming, and basic graphics rendering. Although Java Applets are deprecated in modern environments, this project serves as a hands-on demonstration of foundational Java GUI development.

## üß† Introduction

Java is a platform-independent, object-oriented programming language with strong GUI capabilities via AWT and Swing. This stopwatch project utilizes **AWT** components and **Java Applet** to simulate a real-time stopwatch that can run in an applet viewer. Key features:

- Interactive interface using AWT
- Real-time updates via multithreading
- Dynamic lap tracking using ArrayList
- Time formatting with millisecond precision

Despite the outdated nature of applets, this project provides a strong learning base for Java GUI concepts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Techniques Used

1. **Applet Programming**  
   Lifecycle methods: `init()`, `start()`, `stop()`, `paint()`.

2. **AWT GUI Components**  
   `Button`, `Panel`, `FlowLayout`, `BorderLayout`.

3. **Event Handling**  
   Implements `ActionListener` to respond to button clicks.

4. **Multithreading**  
   Background thread refreshes display every 10 milliseconds.

5. **Graphics Rendering**  
   Uses `Graphics` class to draw current time and lap data.

6. **Data Structures**  
   Lap times are stored in an `ArrayList<Long>`.

7. **Time Management**  
   Uses `System.currentTimeMillis()` and custom formatting to display elapsed time.

8. **Object-Oriented Programming Principles**  
   - **Encapsulation**
   - **Modularity**
   - **Reusability**

## üíª Code Overview

The core logic resides in the `StopwatchApplet` class, which:
- Implements `Runnable` and `ActionListener`
- Manages stopwatch state and timing
- Draws the UI dynamically
- Handles all user interactions

### Key Features:
```java
startButton.addActionListener(this);
stopButton.addActionListener(this);
resetButton.addActionListener(this);
lapButton.addActionListener(this);


‚úÖ Functionalities & Results

Function	Status	Description
Start	‚úÖ	Starts or resumes the stopwatch.
Stop	‚úÖ	Pauses the stopwatch and holds time.
Reset	‚úÖ	Resets time and clears lap history.
Lap	‚úÖ	Records the current time as a lap.
Real-Time	‚úÖ	Timer updates every 10ms via a background thread.
UI	‚úÖ	Time and lap data rendered dynamically.
üìä Performance Evaluation
Accuracy: Updates every 10 milliseconds

Responsiveness: Instant button feedback

Usability: Clean layout and easy interaction

Data Handling: Correct use of collections for lap tracking

‚úÖ Key Strengths:
Accurate time tracking

Clean and minimal interface

Effective use of Java‚Äôs multithreading

Proper formatting and display of lap data

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:
Applets are deprecated and unsupported by modern browsers.

Fixed-size layout; lacks responsive design.

No audio or notifications on actions.

üßæ Summary
This stopwatch project provides a functional demonstration of:

Java Applet lifecycle management

GUI development with AWT

Real-time threading

Data structure usage (ArrayList)

Graphics rendering

Event-driven interaction

Though applets are outdated, this project offers a strong foundation in Java programming and GUI development, and lays the groundwork for future enhancements using modern frameworks like Swing or JavaFX.

üöÄ Future Enhancements
Migrate to JavaFX or Swing for modern UI support

Add sound notifications

Implement save/export feature for lap data

Make layout responsive for different screen sizes
